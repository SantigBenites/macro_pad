# macro_pad

## Introduction

I will be attempting to implement a better way of executing the process described in the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/8geyru/diy_linux_macro_board/).

To this effect, I will use the tool [actkbd](https://github.com/thkala/actkbd), but given my requirements, I will need to tweak it.

I would like to thank the following blog post which simplified the process presented in the Reddit post [blog](https://blog.luk.world/posts/dyi-macro-keyboard-on-linux-elgato-stream-deck/)

## TODO

Add private implementation of actkbd to the git repo

Implement a GUI

Add config file to key binds
